    "It is easy enough to say \"170 points? Easy! Just hit T20, T20, DB.\"\n",
    "But, at least for me, it is much harder to actually execute the plan\n",
    "and hit each target.  In this second half of the question, we\n",
    "investigate what happens if the dart-thrower is not 100% accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a wrong (but still useful) model of inaccuracy. A player\n",
    "has a single number from 0 to 1 that characterizes his/her miss rate.\n",
    "If miss=0.0, that means the player hits the target every time.\n",
    "But if miss is, say, 0.1, then the player misses the section s/he\n",
    "is aiming at 10% of the time, and also (independently) misses the thin\n",
    "double or triple ring 10% of the time. Where do the misses go?\n",
    "Here's the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, for ring accuracy.  If you aim for the triple ring, all the\n",
    "misses go to a single ring (some to the inner one, some to the outer\n",
    "one, but the model doesn't distinguish between these). If you aim for\n",
    "the double ring (at the edge of the board), half the misses (e.g. 0.05\n",
    "if miss=0.1) go to the single ring, and half off the board. (We will\n",
    "agree to call the off-the-board 'target' by the name 'OFF'.) If you\n",
    "aim for a thick single ring, it is about 5 times thicker than the thin\n",
    "rings, so your miss ratio is reduced to 1/5th, and of these, half go to\n",
    "the double ring and half to the triple.  So with miss=0.1, 0.01 will go\n",
    "to each of the double and triple ring.  Finally, for the bulls-eyes. If\n",
    "you aim for the single bull, 1/4 of your misses go to the double bull and\n",
    "3/4 to the single ring.  If you aim for the double bull, it is tiny, so\n",
    "your miss rate is tripled; of that, 2/3 goes to the single ring and 1/3\n",
    "to the single bull ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for section accuracy.  Half your miss rate goes one section clockwise\n",
    "and half one section counter-clockwise from your target. The clockwise \n",
    "order of sections is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    20 1 18 4 13 6 10 15 2 17 3 19 7 16 8 11 14 9 12 5\n",
    "\n",
    "If you aim for the bull (single or double) and miss on rings, then the\n",
    "section you end up on is equally possible among all 20 sections.  But\n",
    "independent of that you can also miss on sections; again such a miss\n",
    "is equally likely to go to any section and should be recorded as being\n",
    "in the single ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to build a model for these probabilities, and define the\n",
    "function outcome(target, miss), which takes a target (like 'T20') and\n",
    "a miss ration (like 0.1) and returns a dict of {target: probability}\n",
    "pairs indicating the possible outcomes.  You will also define\n",
    "best_target(miss) which, for a given miss ratio, returns the target \n",
    "with the highest expected score.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are very ambitious, you can try to find the optimal strategy for\n",
    "accuracy-limited darts: given a state defined by your total score\n",
    "needed and the number of darts remaining in your 3-dart turn, return\n",
    "the target that minimizes the expected number of total 3-dart turns\n",
    "(not the number of darts) required to reach the total.  This is harder\n",
    "than Pig for several reasons: there are many outcomes, so the search space \n",
    "is large; also, it is always possible to miss a double, and thus there is\n",
